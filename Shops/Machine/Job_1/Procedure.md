## Procedure 
 
1. **Hold The Job** : Hold the bar stock In a four Jaw chuck In such a way that at least 140mm of the bar stock is projected outside
the chuck. The one end of workpiece is held in the chuck and the other end in the dead or revolving centre.
 
1. **Centering The Job** :  The work piece is centred so that it rotates exactly around its center axis. For this the sharp end of
needle of the surface gauge should touch on the top of the job near the chuck and rotates the  four jaw chuck with hand, it should touch
all around the job. But if it is displaced then bring it in center by loosen the opposite jaw and tighten the jaw where it touches the
needle. Repeat the procedure till the needle touches uniformly.
 
1. **Setting The Tool** : Hold the turning tool in a tool post in such a way that it projects out of the tool post as little as
practicable to avoid leverage i.e. approx. 30mm to 35mm. The cutting edge of the tool should coincide with the centre axis of the 
workpiece.
 
1. **Turning** : The larger diameter (OD of gear blank) is obtained by first. Giving one or more rough cuts, then finally a finishing cut of not more than 0.75mm. Direction of feed should be towards the head stock. 

       Diameter of gear blank = (N+2)M
 
1. **Step Turning** : 

     1. Mark 25mm length from face end and reduce the diameter to 27mm up to 135mm length from face end. 
       
     2. Again mark 87mm length from face end and reduce the diameter from 27mm to 25.4mm up to 135mm length from face end.
  
     3. Mark 25mm length from face end and reduce the diameter from 27mm to 21mm up to 45mm length from face end.
 
1. **Facing** : All the faces of different steps are faced with the help of parting off  tool.
 
1. **Grooving** : Formula:- CD = OD - 2d

    d = Depth of thread = 0.6403 x pitch
       
    pitch = 1/TIP
       
    TPI = Threads per inch
       
    1" bolt BSW = 8 TPI
 
    Mark 87 mm length from face end and the groove is made 10 mm wide and 5 mm wide with the Help of grooving tool and the diameter is
reduced from 25.4 mm up to core dia. (cd) as calculated above. 
 
1. **Taper Turning** : tan(x) = D-d/2L  or (x) = (D-d/2L) × 144/5
 
     The compound slide is set at a calculated angle i.e. 4°6' and start taper turning with compound slide. 
 
1. **Threading** : To obtain the required threads set the gear mechanism of the lathe for threading operation. When any moving
marking of thread chasing dial coincide with stationary mark then half nut level is engaged with the lead screw to have rough thread.
Repeat the procedure till the required depth of thread is obtained.
 
1. **Knurling  And Chamfering** :  Chamfering is done at the end of the job and gear blank dia. Work piece is cut at length 145mm
from face end. 
 
1. **Spur Gear Cutting** : To obtain the required teeth of the gear on milling machine set the indexing head according the no. of
teeth and module. 
 
       Formula for spur gear:-

       N = no. of teeth = 13

       M = module = 2

       OD of gear blank = (N+2)M = (13+2)2 = 30mm

       Depth of teeth = 2.157 x M

       Indexing = 40/N = 40/13 = 3+1/13 = 3+3/39 

       i.e. 3 complete circle and 3 holes out of 39 hole circle plate.

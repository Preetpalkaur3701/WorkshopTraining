# SHAPER

Shaper is a versatile machine which is primarily intended for producing flat surfaces. These surfaces may be horizontal, vertical or inclined. This machine involves the use of single point toot held in a properly designed tool box mounted on a reciprocating ram.

## Working Principle 

In shaper the job is rigidly held in a machine vice. Tool is held in the tool post mounted on the ram. This ram reciprocates to and fro and so the cutting of the material takes place in the toward stroke of ram and return stroke is ideal. The job is given index feed normal to the line of action of cutting tool.

## Specifications of Shaper

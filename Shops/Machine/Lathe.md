# LATHE MACHINE

A lathe is a powered mechanical device in which the work is held and rotated against a suitable cutting tool for producing cylindrical forms in the metal, wood or any other machinable material.

## Principle of working 

The principle of lathe machine is that it holds the work between two strong supports called as centres, or in a chuck or face plate which revolves. The chuck or the centre is mounted on the main spindle of the machine. The cutting tool is rigidly supported in a tool post and it is fed against the rotating job. The job rotates in its axis and the tool is moved either parallel or to an inclination with its axis as such a cylindrical or tapered surface is produced.

##Types of Lathe:

There are various types of lathe. They are as :
 
 * Precision lathe
 * Tool room lathe 
 * Capstan and turret lathe 
 * Automatic lathe 
 * Engine lathe 
 * Speed lathe 
 * Bench lathe
 * Special purpose lathe  

## Specifications of Lathe Machine

The size of the lathe is specified by one of the following ways:

 - Length of the Bed (Bed length will include headstock).
 - Distance between centres (Max. job length that can be held between centres). 
 - Diameter of the work which can be turned between the ways. (max. dia. that can be rotated). 
 - Height of centres
 - Swing over carriage.

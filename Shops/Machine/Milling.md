# MILLING MACHINE 

A machine tools which is used for producing flat or profiled surfaces, grooves or slots with the help of revolving multiple tooth cutter is known as milling machine. Milling machine occupies a place opposite to lathe. 

## Principle of working

Circular cutter revolves beneath which job is given feed in a straight line, to form chip thickness. Stress on cutting point of the milling cutter is not heavy as that in the lathe. For rest of the revolution it runs idle and can cool off. it cuts only for a part of revolution. 

## Size and Specification 

Milling machine size is defined by the dimension of its table i.e., (Length and Breadth). Other main specification of this machine Is horse power of the motor, speed of the spindle, Feed and the drive. 

## Types of Milling Machines

Milling machines are being made of numerous sizes and types. They are classified as under: 

Column and Knee Type Milling : 
:  Work table is supported on knee like casting which can slide in vertical direction along vertical column. The table can travel longitudinally and cross-wise. It can be moved up and down. It is of three types :
 
   * Horizontal Milling Machine 
   * Vertical Milling Machine 
   * Universal Milling Machine

Planar Milling Machine : 
:  This is high production machine jobs. It is similar to double housing planar. In the planar tool post spindle carries are mounted which are operated by individual motors. In addition two horizontal milling heads are fitted on a cross rail. The other two types are :
 
   * Fixed Bed milling machine 
   * Special types of milling machines.
